# TSP solution using branch and bound in C

This is a semester assignment for my university class of Theory of Graphs.
The assignment is the following:


<<<<<<< HEAD
You need to develop the TSP algorithm with Branch and Bound and apply parallelization to achieve better algorithm execution time. So you have to redesign the algorithm to work with threads to achieve parallelism. The assignment of tasks to the threads should be done in such a way as to achieve proper parallelization and to have an improvement in the performance of the algorithm. At the end, the execution times should be compared with parallelization and without parallelization. Also for parallelization you should have different values ​​regarding the threads that will be used for parallelization e.g., 2, 4, 8, 16.
